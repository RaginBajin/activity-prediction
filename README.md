# Predictin Activities of Daily Living (ADL) using accelerometer data

Exploratory application of classification models for wrist-worn and waist-mounted accelerometer data.

### Data

Download datasets below before running notebook:

* [Dataset for ADL Recognition with Wrist-worn Accelerometer Data Set ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dataset+for+ADL+Recognition+with+Wrist-worn+Accelerometer)
* [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Code

Create a virtualenv to run notebook. All code was run on Python 3.4.2.

```bash
# create a virtual environment, "activity-prediction"
$ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 activity-prediction

# install required modules
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# start ipython notebook
$ workon activity-prediction
$ ipython notebook
```
